      <description>Something that interests me greatly is the thought of the afterlife. What happens at the instant of leaving this world? More especifically, at the conciousness level or as some might say, spiritual.
For now, I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the rabbithole of what conciousness and the spirit (which are mostly thought as the samething) are. I&amp;rsquo;d definitely recommend Julian Jaynes&amp;rsquo; book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind if you want to read up on that and more.</description>

      <description>It is said that one should have a creative outlet, a piece that you can take and show everybody.
As intimate as I think it is, blogging sounds perfect for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve never, ever, been creative in the artsy way, such as drawing or painting.
Yup, I have in the past made fun of people that have in their social media handle, &amp;ldquo;WRITER, BLOGGER, BEST SELLING ARTIST&amp;rdquo; but I can now appriciate on how it makes one feel and why it&amp;rsquo;s important to share that, no matter how miniscule.</description>
