<p>Something that interests me greatly is the thought of the afterlife. What happens at the instant of leaving this world? More especifically, at the conciousness level or as some might say, spiritual.</p>

<p>For now, I won&rsquo;t go into the rabbithole of what conciousness and the spirit (which are mostly thought as the samething) are. I&rsquo;d definitely recommend Julian Jaynes&rsquo; book <a href="https://www.julianjaynes.org/bicameralmind.php"><em>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</em></a> if you want to read up on that and more.</p>

<p>First, a point I want to make is the intricacy of conciousness. Think of the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conscious retrospection is not the retrieval of images, but the retrieval of what you have been conscious of before, and the reworking of these elements into rational or plausible patterns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are severely limited by what we see or are concious of. In fact, we do most things without being concious. Take for example, a pianist. With years of practice, her musle memory is superb and just needs some daily practice to be on top shape, she may even have the music notes in front of her. She can play the piano without looking. Now, if instructed to see herself playing, thinking of what key is next, she will most definitely become slow, and more prone to error.</p>

<p>Our mind might be a jail and our concious, thinking self the jailer. That directs me to my first question, what happens after death? Is it simply empty darkness, a place of nothingness? This thought seems most probable, but hard to fathom. A good excersiese of this is, think of when before you were born. All the billions of years before creation. Was there a conciousness waiting for you to be born? Is it born with the self?</p>

<p>Now, what I enjoy thinking about is that conciousness is bound to us for small amount of time. At the time of expiration, it&rsquo;s free from the shackles of physical limitation and is able to traverse the infinite amount of universes, within or out of ours. This eternal voyage through an vast, endless sea of nothingness, with sprinkled in planets, stars, and maybe, civilizations. We can see the mysteries of the universe, and see humanity&rsquo;s destiny among the stars.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my momentary escape to those thoughts linger in the state of boredness. I cannot fathom, nothingness, as my mind is busy with all the noise that are my thoughts and surroundings. But being bored, grants me a glimpse of might yet to come, after our passing.</p>
