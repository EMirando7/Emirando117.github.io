      <description>It is said that one should have a creative outlet, a piece that you can take and show everybody.
As intimate as I think it is, blogging sounds perfect for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve never, ever, been creative in the artsy way, such as drawing or painting.
Yup, I have in the past made fun of people that have in their social media handle, &amp;ldquo;WRITER, BLOGGER, BEST SELLING ARTIST&amp;rdquo; but I can now appriciate on how it makes one feel and why it&amp;rsquo;s important to share that, no matter how miniscule.</description>
